# Healthcare Translation Assistant

A real-time medical translation application that uses voice input, AI-powered translation, and text-to-speech output to facilitate communication between healthcare providers and patients who speak different languages.

## Features

- üé§ Real-time voice-to-text transcription using Web Speech API
- üîÑ AI-powered translation using OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo
- üîä Text-to-speech playback of translations
- üì± Mobile-first responsive design
- üåê Support for multiple languages
- üîí No transcript storage (privacy-focused)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Speech-to-Text**: Web Speech API
- **Translation**: OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo
- **Text-to-Speech**: Web Speech Synthesis API

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- OpenAI API key

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd healthcare-translation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

1. Select the source language (the language you'll be speaking in)
2. Select the target language (the language you want to translate to)
3. Click "Start Recording" and speak clearly
4. The app will transcribe your speech and translate it in real-time
5. Click "Speak Translation" to hear the translated text

## Security Considerations

- No transcript data is stored on the server
- All processing happens in the browser
- OpenAI API calls are made directly from the client
- HTTPS is required for Web Speech API access

## Development

The project follows a modular structure:

- `/src/app`: Next.js app router pages
- `/src/components`: Reusable UI components
- `/src/hooks`: Custom React hooks
- `/src/lib`: Utility functions and store
- `/src/types`: TypeScript type definitions
